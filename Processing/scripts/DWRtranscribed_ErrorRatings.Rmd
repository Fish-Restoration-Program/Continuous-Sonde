The goal of this file is to import worksheets from Survey123 and make RData files to use in the Processing script

First, we'll import the Exchange Worksheets and their crosswalk (these were generated using the first version of the CDFW Survey123 e-forms)
```{r}
rm(list = ls())

# read in the crosswalk file for renaming columns of raw Survey123 export file (Must make sure version matches)
df_Ratings <- rbind.data.frame(data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("raw","DWR_ErrorTransferWorksheet_Kiana.xlsx"), sheet = "ARN")),
                               data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("raw","DWR_ErrorTransferWorksheet_Kiana.xlsx"), sheet = "BRD")),
                               data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("raw","DWR_ErrorTransferWorksheet_Kiana.xlsx"), sheet = "LYR")),
                               data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("raw","DWR_ErrorTransferWorksheet_Kiana.xlsx"), sheet = "TRC")),
                               data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("raw","DWR_ErrorTransferWorksheet_Kiana.xlsx"), sheet = "TRB_TRM")),
                               data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("raw","DWR_ErrorTransferWorksheet_Kiana.xlsx"), sheet = "WNG")),
                               data.frame(readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("raw","DWR_ErrorTransferWorksheet_Kiana.xlsx"), sheet = "WNT"))
                               )

# create crosswalk for the different variable names to match pipeline's naming scheme
cw_varX <- data.frame(varX = c("temp","pH","DO","sc","turb"), # pipeline's naming scheme
                      Channel = c("Water Temp","pH","DO","SpC","Turbidity")) # DWR channel names

## Merge with crosswalk to get varX naming scheme
# First, check that merge didn't change length of data frame
nrow(merge(df_Ratings, cw_varX, by = "Channel", all.x = TRUE)) == nrow(df_Ratings) # TRUE, so continue with merge
df_Ratings.2 <- merge(df_Ratings, cw_varX, by = "Channel", all.x = TRUE)

# Subset columns of interest and re-order
DWR_Ratings <- df_Ratings.2[,c("varX","SondeID","DateRecovered","Rating")]
# Rename columns to match pipeline's naming scheme
colnames(DWR_Ratings) <- c("varX","sondeID","dateRecov","Rating_final")

unique(DWR_Ratings$Rating_final)
DWR_Ratings$Rating_final[which(DWR_Ratings$Rating_final %in% c("Max Limit","Max. Limit"))] <- "MaxLimit"

save(DWR_Ratings, file = here::here("working","DWRtranscribed_Ratings.RData"))
```

The above ratings (transcribed from DWR error calculation worksheets in Excel) will be loaded into the chunk labeled '{r Apply quality scores}' in the script "ContinuousSonde_Processing.Rmd"
