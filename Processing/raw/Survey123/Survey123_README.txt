This folder contains files from the Survey123 forms that serve as worksheets for EXO2 Calibrations as well as Exchanges. The Survey123 files exist in "C:\Users\DCox\ArcGIS\My Survey Designs" and online at https://survey123.arcgis.com/surveys using the AGOL account 'cdfw_frpmt'

The "Exchanges230630_ColumnCrosswalk.csv" contains multiple columns to import into R so that the variable labels can be returned to variable names (no duplicates) for the Exchange Worksheet version created on 230630. The same applies for "Calibration230612_ColumnCrosswalk.csv"



Archive folder contains older export files:
The "Exchanges230630_Export230703.csv" is the export file from Survey123 for the Exchange Worksheet. It contains records for 2022 alone. Calibrations for sondes deployed in 2022 are found in "Calibration230612_Export230706.csv"
